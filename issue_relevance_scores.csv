As Trump attacks public health, particularly reproductive healthcare, Zohran will also guarantee that these outreach workers connect every New Yorker in need of reproductive care to affordable, quality support.  Moreover, New York’s public hospital system serves over one million unique patients a year and is the crown jewel of our public health infrastructure—but it faces significant funding gaps, leading to underinvestment, understaffing and overburdened caregivers. Meanwhile, we keep closing our critical community hospitals. Zohran will work with our healthcare unions and city and state partners to increase funding for H+H and end hospital closures. He will also protect NYC for future public health emergencies, including guarding against shortages of PPE, ensuring adequate surge capacity and healthcare worker safety, maintaining programs like Test and Trace to stay on top of trends, and more.
HEALTHCARE: As Mayor, Zohran will reject Medicare Advantage, and reject higher copays for inservice workers. Instead he’ll partner with workers and their unions to take on the fragmented, for-profit healthcare system and lower costs for everyone.
LEGISLATION: The delivery app industry has transformed New York City. Delivery workers are fundamental to keeping this city running—supplying groceries, meals, and medications 24/7. Traveling around the city at breakneck speeds, app-based delivery workers now hold the most dangerous job in NYC. Despite the immense risks these workers face every day, deliveristas—80,000 Black, brown, and immigrant workers—are exploited by the app companies who demand they complete deliveries at a dangerous pace. Moreover, app companies have misclassified delivery workers as independent contractors, instead of employees, so that they can avoid providing them with the rights and benefits all workers deserve. New York City app consumers, restaurant owners, small businesses, cyclists, and pedestrians all suffer due to app companies’ predatory policies. The ever-increasing demands from app companies make our streets less safe, and deliveristas more vulnerable. To address these issues, the Mamdani administration will strengthen licensure requirements for delivery apps, expand capacity and resources to support deliveristas, and improve street infrastructure including expanding DOT e-bike programs and investing in deliverista hubs.
WAGES / JOB BENEFITS: As Mayor, Zohran will work closely with our city's powerful labor movement to ensure that union- and non-union workers alike know and can enforce their rights at work, including by fully staffing and expanding the role of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. He will continue fighting for the Secure Jobs Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize without fear of unfair or retaliatory firings. Through requiring high-road labor standards for all City contractors, City-financed development projects, and City-funded organizations and their contractors and expanding labor peace agreement requirements, he’ll ensure that all workers, including public sector workers, have the right to collective bargaining and to fight for strong contracts. Finally, Zohran will work closely with unions to pass additional sectoral extender laws that provide better wages and working conditions across entire industries, similar to NYC’s fast-food minimum wage law. 
ECONOMY: Zohran will make it faster, easier, and cheaper to start and run a business in New York City, so that bodegas and corner stores stay open and dollar slices come back. He will cut small business fines in half, speed up permitting and make online applications easier, and increase funding for 1:1 small business support by 500 percent. And he’ll appoint a Mom-and-Pop Czar to make sure it happens.
HOUSING: 25% of all NYC homeowners spend more than half their income on housing, a burden felt most acutely in our city’s immigrant communities and Black and Latino neighborhoods. Prior to becoming an Assemblymember, Zohran worked directly with these New Yorkers to keep them in their homes, serving as a Foreclosure Prevention Housing Counselor. He knows how the city’s property tax system favors wealthier homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods, has seen how the tax lien sale system leads to families losing their homes, recognizes how deed theft is displacing entire communities, and understands how the city lets speculators and slumlords box working class New Yorkers out of homes. And he has a plan to fix it as Mayor.  Zohran will create a new Office of Deed Theft Prevention to protect homeowners from scam artists. He’ll fix the property tax system so the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods pay their fair share. He’ll help homeowners comply with Local Law 97. And he’ll end the tax lien sale.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Zohran will create the Department of Community Safety to prevent violence before it happens by prioritizing solutions which have been consistently shown to improve safety. Police have a critical role to play. But right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net—which prevents them from doing their actual jobs. Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%.
WAGES / JOB BENEFITS: As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to 30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases. When working people have more money in their pocket, the whole economy thrives.
TAXES / BUDGET: Zohran’s revenue plan will raise the corporate tax rate to match New Jersey’s 11.5%, bringing in 5 billion. And he will tax the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers—those earning above 1 million annually—a flat 2% tax (right now city income tax rates are essentially the same whether you make 50,000 or 50 million).
HOUSING: As Mayor, Zohran will put our public dollars to work and triple the City’s production of permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes – constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years.
HOUSING: As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent.
SOCIAL SERVICES: As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing.
SOCIAL SERVICES: Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families. And he will bring up wages for childcare workers – a quarter of whom currently live in poverty – to be at parity with public school teachers.
HOUSING: Every New Yorker deserves a safe and healthy place to call home. That’s why Zohran will overhaul the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and coordinate code enforcement under one roof, making sure agencies work together to hold owners responsible for the conditions of their buildings.
TAXES / BUDGET: Zohran will also implement common-sense procurement reform, end senseless no-bid contracts, hire more tax auditors, and crack down on fine collection from corrupt landlords to raise an additional 1 billion.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: As Mayor, he’ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus – and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way.
SOCIAL SERVICES: As Mayor, I will end the practice of using library funding as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations and commit 0.5% of NYC’s budget to libraries, ensuring we have enough revenue for robust services and well-staffed facilities.
EDUCATION: Zohran will ensure our public schools are fully funded with equally distributed resources, strong after-school programs, mental health counselors and nurses, compliant and effective class sizes, and integrated student bodies. He will create car-free “School Streets” to prevent traffic fatalities, improve play, and lower pollution for every school, and address student homelessness by expanding the successful Bronx pilot Every Child and Family Is Known. Zohran supports an end to mayoral control and envisions a system instead in which parents, students, educators and administrators work together to create the school environments in which students and families will best thrive—strengthening co-governance through the PEP, SLTs, DLTs, and CECs in particular. He will also work with the City and State to massively invest in CUNY—whether taxing NYU and Columbia or passing the New Deal for CUNY which he has long championed—to invest in infrastructure, pay staff and faculty a living wage, give free OMNY cards to all students, and make CUNY tuition-free for all students, as it was for 130 years.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: Fighting the climate crisis and improving quality of life are not separate issues, but are deeply intertwined. Zohran has a plan to deliver a better and cleaner New York, including an unprecedented investment in our public schools. Zohran’s Green Schools for a Healthier New York City will renovate 500 public schools with renewable energy infrastructure and HVAC upgrades, transform 500 asphalt schoolyards into vibrant green spaces, create 15,000 union jobs, and build resilience hubs in 50 schools that provide resources and safe spaces during emergencies.
CIVIL RIGHTS: Queer and trans people across the United States are facing an increasingly hostile political environment. New York City must be a refuge for LGBTQIA people, but private institutions in our own city have already started capitulating to Trump’s assault on trans rights. Meanwhile, the cost of living crisis confronting working class people across the city hits the LGBTQIA community particularly hard, with higher rates of unemployment and homelessness than the rest of the city. The Mamdani administration will protect LGBTQIA New Yorkers by expanding and protecting gender-affirming care citywide, making NYC an LGBTQIA sanctuary city, and creating the Office of LGBTQIA Affairs."

This will include building out renewable energy on our abundant public lands and fulfilling the vision of Local Law 97 through greater enforcement and assistance from the City for middle income homeowners. He will also oversee a disaster preparedness program that prioritizes safe and resilient housing, public waterfronts, and other infrastructure at the forefront of flood protection, and use a multi-agency approach to tackle extreme heat, which kills more people—particularly New Yorkers of color—than any other type of weather event. Finally, as ConEd tries to raise utility rates by over 10%, Zohran will firmly oppose these exorbitant hikes
HEALTHCARE: Twelve percent of New York City residents are uninsured. To expand access to healthcare, Zohran will create a new corps of outreach workers to support New Yorkers navigating the healthcare system. Those workers will support patients in understanding the public resources available to them: how to find insurance, apply to programs, access financial assistance, and claim their health benefits.

Every child deserves the resources and attention they need to thrive.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: NYPD has the lowest number of police officers in its ranks in decades. The solution is NOT relaxing requirements; it’s simple supply and demand. We need to pay our entry-level police more to attract and retain qualified officers. As a first responder, I know real public safety is built on trust and collaboration between those on the front lines and the communities they serve. By ensuring we hire and keep the best, Precincts 109 and 111 will be stronger and better equipped to keep our communities safe.
ARTS / CULTURE: Public art has the power to bring communities together, beautify our streets, and have a positive economic impact. That’s why I will start the District 19 Mural Program — an initiative that will support nearby artists, engage the art programs in our local schools, deter graffiti, and turn blank walls into vibrant reflections of our shared identity.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Extreme heat is a growing danger in our city, especially for our children and seniors, killing more than 500 New Yorkers each year. One of the most cost-effective and proven ways to combat the urban heat island effect is by investing in tree canopies and sidewalk shade. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY:  Protect Our Pedestrians.  We must prioritize pedestrian safety — especially near our elementary schools, parks, and senior centers. One effective strategy is daylighting, which improves visibility at intersections so drivers can better see pedestrians and pedestrians can better see oncoming traffic. 
HEALTHCARE: We must support Intro 1096 to permanently protect the City’s retirees’ right to comprehensive, reliable healthcare. Together we can ensure they are never again forced onto Medicare Advantage or any other inferior, for-profit plan that limits their coverage and choice. Our city’s retirees spent their careers serving New York; they’ve earned healthcare they can count on.
DEFENSE / VETERANS: Our veterans, who fought on the front lines to protect our freedoms, deserve more. Right now, the NYC Department of Veteran Services receives just 0.001% of the City’s total budget. With more funding, we can expand housing priority and vouchers, increase job support, broaden care for suicide and drug prevention, and fight for veterans to have access to comprehensive healthcare.
TAXES / BUDGET: Owners of luxury condos are getting massive breaks on their property taxes. That’s because the system uses outdated rules that let ultra-high-end properties in Manhattan pay far less than they should, while working- and middle-class homeowners in Queens end up paying more than their fair share. It’s time we close these loopholes and ensure luxury properties are taxed based on what they’re truly worth. This will bring in much-needed revenue for the City without raising taxes on middle-class homeowners."

Together we can ensure they are never again forced onto Medicare Advantage or any other inferior, for-profit plan that limits their coverage and choice. Our city’s retirees spent their careers serving New York; they’ve earned healthcare they can count on.
DEFENSE / VETERANS: Our veterans, who fought on the front lines to protect our freedoms, deserve more. Right now, the NYC Department of Veteran Services receives just 0.001% of the City’s total budget. With more funding, we can expand housing priority and vouchers, increase job support, broaden care for suicide and drug prevention, and fight for veterans to have access to comprehensive healthcare.
TAXES / BUDGET: Owners of luxury condos are getting massive breaks on their property taxes. That’s because the system uses outdated rules that let ultra-high-end properties in Manhattan pay far less than they should, while working- and middle-class homeowners in Queens end up paying more than their fair share. It’s time we close these loopholes and ensure luxury properties are taxed based on what they’re truly worth. This will bring in much-needed revenue for the City without raising taxes on middle-class homeowners."

I will fight to ensure New York City Public Schools raises wages we can recruit and retain the skilled support staff our students rely on. Every child deserves the resources and attention they need to thrive.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: NYPD has the lowest number of police officers in its ranks in decades. The solution is NOT relaxing requirements; it’s simple supply and demand. We need to pay our entry-level police more to attract and retain qualified officers. As a first responder, I know real public safety is built on trust and collaboration between those on the front lines and the communities they serve. By ensuring we hire and keep the best, Precincts 109 and 111 will be stronger and better equipped to keep our communities safe.
ARTS / CULTURE: Public art has the power to bring communities together, beautify our streets, and have a positive economic impact. That’s why I will start the District 19 Mural Program — an initiative that will support nearby artists, engage the art programs in our local schools, deter graffiti, and turn blank walls into vibrant reflections of our shared identity.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Extreme heat is a growing danger in our city, especially for our children and seniors, killing more than 500 New Yorkers each year. One of the most cost-effective and proven ways to combat the urban heat island effect is by investing in tree canopies and sidewalk shade. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY:  Protect Our Pedestrians.  We must prioritize pedestrian safety — especially near our elementary schools, parks, and senior centers. One effective strategy is daylighting, which improves visibility at intersections so drivers can better see pedestrians and pedestrians can better see oncoming traffic.

CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: I will champion a dual approach that combines rigorous enforcement with preventative education. Working with the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, we will ensure that hate crimes are investigated thoroughly and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Simultaneously, we will invest in extensive training programs for first responders, educators, and community leaders to recognize, prevent, and address hate-based incidents.
EDUCATION: Every child deserves access to free enriching after-school programs, no matter where they go to school. Right now, Title 1 families lose out if they choose to go to a non title 1 school. That must end. Expanding free after-school access will drive diversity, equity, and stronger educational outcomes.
EDUCATION: Free CUNY: Guaranteeing College Access for All NYC should promise every high school graduate a free, guaranteed spot at CUNY for two years. College transforms lives and careers. Let’s make it a reality for every student—not a privilege for the few.
EDUCATION: Early detection of learning disabilities changes lives. Disproportionately, those in our prison system had undiagnosed learning challenges. We must implement universal early screening so that every child receives the resources they need before challenges become barriers.
EDUCATION: Too many students drop out because they need to work. Let’s re-imagine high school—with paid, career-building internships that provide real-world experience, income, and a pathway to long-term success.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: The goal is to transform policing from a force that is perceived as occupying to one that is trusted and collaborative. By building stronger relationships and utilizing data to drive proactive measures, we can create safer, more connected neighborhoods throughout our city.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: By investing in these infrastructural improvements and innovative technology, we can create safer streets for all New Yorkers while supporting a vision of urban mobility that respects both pedestrians and cyclists.
HOUSING: Housing Development Fund Corporation (HDFC)s are the soul of affordable homeownership in NYC. We’ll protect these co-ops from predatory threats, expand the tax exemption and ensure they stay affordable and vibrant for generations.
HOUSING: Land for the people, not for profit. By placing publicly owned land into land trusts dedicated to building 100% permanently affordable housing, we can shield these developments from market speculation.
HEALTHCARE: Programs that provide comprehensive services for people with mental health issues and have serious mental health issues. They need an infusion of resources to meet the massive demand. Let’s end the cycle of neglect and build a system that works for everyone.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: By integrating our public safety approach with robust mental health support, we can reduce repeat incidents and foster community resilience. This strategy also includes investing in crisis stabilization centers and supportive housing options for those in need, ensuring that care extends beyond the moment of crisis and into long-term recovery and stability.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We'll deploy a citywide network of publicly available EV charging stations in every neighborhood—equitable, accessible, and powered by clean energy.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We'll install publicly accessible recycling and compost bins on every block, especially in high-traffic and underserved areas. This isn’t just about infrastructure—it’s about culture.
EDUCATION: College isn’t the only road to success. We must invest in trade schools—offering direct pipelines to high-paying, union-protected jobs in skilled trades and emerging industries. Every student deserves a clear path to economic independence.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: In partnership with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, we will expand mobile mental health outreach teams—such as an enhanced B-HEARD and SHOW program—to intervene in real time.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We’ll fund and enforce rigorous inspections and real consequences for bad landlords, and invest in permanent remediation. Clean indoor air isn’t a luxury—it’s a right. Safe housing is climate policy, public health policy, and racial justice policy all in one. We won’t wait for another crisis. We’ll deliver proactive enforcement, accountability, and real solutions.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: I will work closely with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the NYC Department of Design and Construction to install protective bollards on all subway platforms.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We'll map, prioritize, and fully remediate city-controlled brownfields and environmental hazards, turning environmental liabilities into community assets. This isn’t just about soil—it’s about justice, health, and reclaiming space for the public good.
EDUCATION: Universal 2K & 3K: A Game-Changer for Families NYC has tested early childhood education pilots. It’s time to go all in. Expanding free, high-quality early education citywide gives every family—regardless of income—access to a strong foundation for lifelong success.
HOUSING: It’s time to at least double the number of apartments being developed for people experiencing homelessness and battling mental health challenges. These homes will come with on-site support, ensuring that no one falls through the cracks. A just NYC starts with safe, stable housing for all.
HOUSING: Growth should benefit everyone—no exceptions. In addition, we need to preserve what affordable housing we have and ensure they remain permanently affordable.
EDUCATION: Tuition isn’t the only barrier—books, MetroCards, food, and housing can make or break a student’s ability to stay in school. For students with financial need, we must provide wraparound support—free transportation, meal plans, and housing—to ensure real, sustainable access to higher education.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We’ll retrofit schools, libraries, and housing with state-of-the-art energy-saving systems, and rapidly expand solar, geothermal, and battery storage on public rooftops and lots.
HOUSING: Revive the Mitchell-Lama program and build modern, sustainable housing for the middle class. The state has provided necessary capital funds, now we need to put that into action. Permanently affordable, accessible, and built to last—because the middle class deserves a future in our city.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: By combining physical infrastructure enhancements with a compassionate, health-centered response, we can create a transit environment where every rider feels secure, cared for, and valued. This initiative reaffirms our commitment to a safe, inclusive, and forward-thinking public transportation system.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: Supercharge Community Composting Across All Five Boroughs New York City must lead with innovation and integrity when it comes to food waste. We will invest in and fully restore the vibrant network of community composting hubs that have long powered neighborhood sustainability—from school gardens to local farmers markets.
HOUSING: NYCHA needs more than a facelift—it needs a lifeline. Fully funded, fully livable public housing for 400,000 New Yorkers is a must. Dignity starts with a safe, healthy home. This requires a commitment and investment in the capital needs of our existing public housing that must start now.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We'll introduce bold waste reduction mandates in all government contracts and public buildings, phasing out single-use plastics, streamlining supply chains, and mandating compost and recycling infrastructure.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: We will enhance the training of 911 operators and first responders to ensure that mental health professionals are dispatched to crises whenever appropriate.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: Accelerate the EV Revolution with Public Charging Access on Every Block To move away from dirty fossil fuels, New Yorkers need convenient, street-level access to electric vehicle charging.

Officers will be encouraged to engage directly with residents through regular community meetings, neighborhood advisory boards, and local events.

This can be done through tax incentives, zoning adjustments, and by prioritizing the creation of affordable units in new housing projects.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: We must also invest in improving infrastructure, including public transportation, utilities, and green spaces, to enhance the overall quality of life in District 7.
ECONOMY: The waterfront area at the end of 125th Street presents a significant opportunity to boost our local economy. By opening up this area for recreational and tourism development, we could revitalize this waterfront and create jobs in hospitality, entertainment, and tourism. Nearby restaurants and small businesses would thrive with the increased foot traffic, creating a bustling, vibrant area for both locals and tourists to enjoy.
EDUCATION: In addition to youth employment programs, we must provide access to job training and educational initiatives to ensure young people are ready for the evolving job market. I propose partnerships with local community colleges and vocational schools to create a pipeline of skilled workers who are prepared to meet the demands of growing industries.
ECONOMY: I propose that at least half of the miscellaneous allocations in the City’s 112.4 billion budget (see CSSNY Analysis) be directed toward expanding youth employment programs.
HOUSING: I propose that we build taller, more efficient housing units in areas with high demand. By increasing the density of housing in key areas, we can expand the supply and bring relief to the housing shortage. However, we must be mindful of maintaining affordability and creating sustainable, eco-friendly developments.
HOUSING: I am committed to ensuring that Local Law 18 remains a strong safeguard for tenants and homeowners. As your representative, I will be a watchdog, ensuring that this important regulation remains intact to protect the integrity and affordability of our housing market.
ECONOMY: The stretch of Amsterdam Avenue between CUNY and Columbia University holds the potential to become a Harlem Silicon Valley. I propose creating a network of incubators and innovation hubs that foster the growth of startups, tech companies, and local entrepreneurs. By attracting manufacturers and industries identified by the Department of Labor as in-demand and forecast to grow, we can create good-paying, long-term jobs in the community.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: As we build new housing, I will advocate for incorporating green building techniques that reduce energy consumption and carbon footprints. Sustainable, eco-friendly housing will not only benefit the environment but also reduce long-term living costs for tenants, making housing even more affordable."

This can be done through tax incentives, zoning adjustments, and by prioritizing the creation of affordable units in new housing projects.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: We must also invest in improving infrastructure, including public transportation, utilities, and green spaces, to enhance the overall quality of life in District 7.
ECONOMY: The waterfront area at the end of 125th Street presents a significant opportunity to boost our local economy. By opening up this area for recreational and tourism development, we could revitalize this waterfront and create jobs in hospitality, entertainment, and tourism. Nearby restaurants and small businesses would thrive with the increased foot traffic, creating a bustling, vibrant area for both locals and tourists to enjoy.
EDUCATION: In addition to youth employment programs, we must provide access to job training and educational initiatives to ensure young people are ready for the evolving job market.

Edafe will also make sure Columbia fulfills its commitment to supporting HDFCs in our neighborhood.
IMMIGRATION: Refugees arriving in New York have a range of needs, from housing to education to work. New York City should create a Welcome, Reception, and Integration Program, helping newly arrived immigrants access services and integrate into our community.
WAGES / JOB BENEFITS: Edafe will support the Small Business Jobs Survival Act, which would stabilize rents for locally owned small businesses and help them to compete with big box stores.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: Astroturf used in many of the city’s parks currently contains forever chemicals. If elected, Edafe will co-sponsor Councilmember Marte’s bill banning astroturf from city parks.
ECONOMY: By processing more street vendor permits, we can improve consumer protection while also preventing the largely immigrant workforce from being criminalized–and while generating revenue for the city.
HEALTHCARE: Edafe Okporo’s platform centers on expanding access to health services, protecting retirees' healthcare, and ensuring New Yorkers receive equitable care. He recognizes the importance of addressing the city’s growing mental health crisis and advocates for comprehensive mental health services as part of his vision for a healthier and more supportive New York City.
HEALTHCARE: As a city councilmember, Edafe would support Intro 0770-2024 that would provide 365 days per year home-delivered meals and Intro 0237-2024 that would provide grab-and-go meals for older adults."
