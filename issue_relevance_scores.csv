TAXES / BUDGET: John Reid believes YOU know best how to live your life and will fight to allow adults to make their own decisions without government intervention. He also believes we all must pay our own bills and personally own and be responsible for the consequences- good and bad- of our decisions.
TAXES / BUDGET: John will fight to finally eliminate the hated car tax and to lower real estate taxes and burdensome business taxes. Government must do less with less.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: John knows that a stable and safe community is dependent on strong and fair individuals who deal with good citizens in their worst moments and deal with violent and deviant criminals every day. John stands with law enforcement.
GUNS: Defending the Second Amendment.
WAGES / JOB BENEFITS: Bringing Business and Jobs to Virginia.
EDUCATION: His focus is on ensuring that our educational system imparts knowledge and critical thinking skills, not political bias, preparing students for success in a diverse world instead of creating radical activists.

ABORTION / CONTRACEPTION: Pro life.",8,8
Z2lkOi8vYmFsbG90LWZhY3RvcnkvQ2FuZGlkYWN5LzEwNTU2MDc=,Delores R. Oates,49.216,"GUNS: “The right of the people to own and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Our Second Amendment rights have secured the survival of the Republic. Currently, we are seeing elected bodies across the country using tragedy as an opportunity for increased gun legislation. As your Delegate, I will defend our constitutional rights.
ABORTION / CONTRACEPTION: We must protect the rights and the life of the unborn. Human life begins at conception, and we are morally and legally obligated to safeguard the life of the unborn. As your Delegate, I will support legislation that will defend the unborn and their mothers.
CIVIL RIGHTS: Our country was founded on the basis of escaping tyrannical rule and the freedom to live and worship how we please. In fact, the Statute of Religious Freedom was written right here in Virginia. Any law that prohibits or restricts religious practice is a clear violation of the first amendment. We must continue to ensure that people are free to practice their religious beliefs without government interference.
TAXES / BUDGET: Hardworking Virginians have been hit hard enough by rising prices and bloated government. As your Delegate, I will work to reduce taxes for Virginians and ensure that your money is working for you. We need to spur economic growth in District 31, the first step in doing that is reducing taxes and creating a more business-friendly Virginia.
DRUG POLICY: Sadly, almost everyone today has a friend or relative that has been effected by the opioid epidemic. I have actively been involved in my community to create avenues to recovery for those that are trapped by this horrible sickness. We must create more opportunities to provide assistance to those in desperate need for recovery. Through physical recovery centers and trained mental healthcare providers we will be the solution to this deadly disease that is sweeping through our Commonwealth and our Country.
IMMIGRATION: National Security is border security. We cannot continue to exist as a sovereign nation as long as our border security stays underfunded and unimportant to our elected leaders. The privilege to live in the United States has a process in place to allow for legal and safe immigration. It is essential to the safety and security of the citizens of this Country that our borders are secure. In the House of Delegates, I will oppose so-called ‘sanctuary city’ policies and in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. We should not be rewarding those who break our nation’s laws.
EDUCATION: Ensuring that our children receive a topflight education is my top priority. However, we must ensure parents remain the primary educators and drivers of what their children learn. Parents have a fundamental right to choose what students are taught in the classroom. That includes not just curriculum but school choice, vouchers, and tax credits for parents who homeschool their kids. The role of educators should be to prepare the leaders and the workforce of tomorrow, and teach them how to think, not to indoctrinate them with a woke agenda.
GOVERNMENT REFORM: Being a public servant means sacrificing personal gains for the betterment of the community. As your next Delegate, I remain committed to being a servant leader for Virginia. It is vitally important that the public can place their trust in elected leadership. We can achieve this through increased government transparency and eliminating the ability to profit off elected office.
GOVERNMENT REFORM: It is paramount to the future of our Commonwealth and our Country that we restore the trust and integrity of our elections. No citizen should question whether their vote has been accurately collected or counted for who or what they vote for, regardless of their affiliated party. We can achieve this through audits of future elections and common sense voter identification protections.",10,10
Z2lkOi8vYmFsbG90LWZhY3RvcnkvQ2FuZGlkYWN5LzEwNTU3MDM=,"Andrew ""Andy"" B. Pittman",46.498,"CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Andy Pittman supports our crimefighters and first responders and steadfastly opposes efforts to defund the police.
GUNS: Andy understands and defends the Constitution and believes that our First Amendment rights would be at risk without the Second Amendment.
WAGES / JOB BENEFITS: Andy believes in freedom for workers and for small businesses. He supports keeping Virginia's right to work status so no one is forced to join and pay dues to a union without his or her consent.
ABORTION / CONTRACEPTION: For Andy, pro-life is not just a political slogan. It's a way of life. We must improve the quality of life for all Virginians – from the preborn and infants to the elderly. Ensuring mothers have the quality medical and economic support needed to care for their children, the highest quality education for students, taking care of seniors, and strengthening the economy so that parents don’t need multiple jobs to support a family, are all top priorities.
TAXES / BUDGET: We need to eliminate the car tax to make life more affordable.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Recent years have only proven what we've all known is true - violent criminals belong in prison and not in our neighborhoods. Our opponents in the House of Delegates defend shorter sentences for criminals putting our families at risk. Andy Pittman will make sure those who do the crime do the time.
EDUCATION: Andy Pittman thinks parents should choose the best educational environment for their children and tax dollars should follow that choice. Schools shouldn't be a place for sexual indoctrination and a weak ""opt out"" option is not enough. Education should focus on learning and preparing students for a successful future.
ECONOMY: Jobs are created when cities are safe, the workforce is educated and taxes stay low. Displaced federal workers will need private sector job opportunities, and Andy Pittman will work to make our cities more attractive to employers who are ready to hire.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: Andy also defends fishermen and wants to see the local fishing industry thrive, and not be destroyed by foreign companies engaged in ""reduction fishing"". This mass catching of menhaden, which destroys the food chain for larger fish, is outlawed in every East Coast state except Virginia. Andy will end the days of dead fish washing up onshore and make the Chesapeake Bay the priority it should be.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing crimes with children being up to 30% of the victims. It is a 150 billion industry and is often paired with other crimes like drug trafficking. We must fight against this scourge and protect the vulnerable through education and invest in training to identify those who may be victimized by traffickers.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: Andy is a stalwart defender of the Chesapeake Bay and supports efforts to keep the Bay clean and pollution free.
DEFENSE / VETERANS: Virginia has always been the home of veterans, but tax policies are making competing states more attractive for many vets. Andy Pittman supports making Virginia the #1 state for veterans by reducing taxes and providing the best career opportunities after military service.
IMMIGRATION: Andy Pittman supports legal immigration and opposes people illegally entering our country. As we've learned in recent years, every state is a border state. We must stop the influx of illegals aliens and drugs at the border.",9,9
Z2lkOi8vYmFsbG90LWZhY3RvcnkvQ2FuZGlkYWN5LzEwNTU2NTQ=,Paul V. Milde III,33.117,"INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: Living along the I-95 corridor, Paul knows transportation is a critical issue for the people of Stafford. Building on his experience as a leader in promoting regional transportation solutions, Paul will take an aggressive approach toward meeting our transportation challenges and reducing gridlock.
EDUCATION: Paul Milde isn’t a biologist. But as the father of two daughters and a son, Paul understands there are innate biological differences between males and females. To ensure fairness and opportunity for Virginia’s school-age athletes, Paul will fight to make sure our schools reserve girls’ sports for biological girls.
DEFENSE / VETERANS: Paul believes Virginia should be America’s most veteran-friendly state. This is why making the proper investments in veteran services is critical to Paul’s approach to honoring those who served.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: Paul will fight for effective land conservation programs in Richmond, giving localities the tools they need to protect against overdevelopment and sprawl.
IMMIGRATION: Paul Milde will support legislation that cuts funding for localities that refuse to work with state and federal law enforcement to enforce our immigration laws. Paul will also support states like Texas and Arizona in their fight to secure our border because the federal government refuses to do so.
ABORTION / CONTRACEPTION: Paul Milde supports Governor Youngkin’s proposal to permit abortions during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, allowing exceptions later in the pregnancy in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is endangered. And because Paul Milde is pro-life, he supports the “Born Alive Infant Act,” which would require life-sustaining care for infants born alive.
GUNS: Paul Milde is a steadfast supporter of our 2nd Amendment rights. A lifetime member of the NRA, and a member of GOA and VCDL, Paul is an avid competitive shooter. Paul will stand up for the liberties of law-abiding Virginians and will fight to protect this critical right.
EDUCATION: To ensure all children have the opportunity to achieve their full potential, Paul Milde supports giving parents a choice in the school their child attends. Paul favors Virginia enacting a law similar to Arizona’s, which rebates parents who choose non-public schools a portion of the cost of alternative learning programs/schools. For parents who select traditional public schools for their children, Paul favors targeting increased educational spending directly in classrooms.",7,7
Z2lkOi8vYmFsbG90LWZhY3RvcnkvQ2FuZGlkYWN5LzEwNTU1NTA=,Mark L. Earley Jr.,31.753,"IMMIGRATION: Mark is also committed to fighting both illegal immigration and fentanyl epidemic. He introduced legislation to ensure Virginia cooperated with immigration authorities when it comes to illegal aliens who have committed serious crimes. Further, Mark has supported legislation to continue battling the fentanyl crisis, and even serves on the Task Force on Fentanyl and Heroin Enforcement.
ECONOMY: We must do everything we can to create a pro-business climate, which includes resisting tax increases and burdensome regulations. Both Mark and his wife Mary work in small businesses, so they understand the challenges and needs that need to be addressed.
HEALTHCARE: Mental health and addiction must also be top priorities. Sadly, many families know the tragedies that result when we fail to address these issues. As an attorney and foster parent, Mark understands how these issues, if unchecked, can lead to untold damage to families and our communities. We must proactively address these issues.
DEFENSE / VETERANS: Our veterans have served us. We must serve them in return. Virginia can and should be the most veteran-friendly state in America. Mark has both supported and introduced legislation to benefit veterans -- from supporting the VMSDEP to working to increase paid leave to assist veteran family members with healthcare, Mark has and will continue to fight for vets.
TAXES / BUDGET: We should minimize the tax burden on our families and businesses so they can keep more of their own hard-earned money. Families and businesses will always know how to use their money more wisely than the government.
EDUCATION: Mark knows we need to support and improve our public schools. Better pay for teachers, smaller class sizes, and improving school infrastructure should be our top priorities. At the same time we’re strengthening our public schools, we should encourage a diversity of educational options. Parents know that children aren’t one-size-fits-all, so neither should our education system be one-size-fits-all.
HEALTHCARE: We need to focus on real solutions to healthcare. We need easier access, better quality, and far more transparency, achieved through a market driven approach that drives down cost. Giving choice to consumers should always be a top priority.
EDUCATION: We need to fully fund our education system. We need to recruit & retain the best & brightest teachers. We need to keep politics out of the classroom. We need to treat students as individuals, understanding that some will go on to higher education, while others will opt to go directly into the workforce. And in all aspects, we need to respect and empower parents.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: While we should always seek to improve and innovate our policing, we should never bend to the calls to defund the police. We can both support our law enforcement, while also insisting on accountability and transparency. We must continue to build trust between police departments and communities.
ECONOMY: We must continue to fight inflation by being wise with the state budget and not overspending. Additionally, we need to work to lower the cost of gas, groceries, and everyday items. Part of that is by embracing an all-of-the-above strategy on energy, to make sure we have affordable energy to power our homes and businesses.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: We must support and fund law enforcement, to ensure responsiveness and effectiveness. We owe our law enforcement better training, better funding, and better support — it makes everyone safer.",8,8

CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: It is no secret that public safety in New York has declined, a direct consequence of misguided policies from our elected officials. Crime rates are on the rise, and the state of the subway system reflects challenges with homelessness and waste. Businesses face threats from shoplifting and theft.  Our platform emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive public safety reforms. Together, let's address the root causes and implement effective solutions to build a safer and more secure New York for all.
SOCIAL SERVICES: Many experiencing homelessness struggle with mental health and addiction issues. Shifting them between overcrowded shelters or expensive hotels without proper treatment isn't enough.  Placing them in residential areas creates safety concerns. We need specialized facilities for mental health support to address these issues effectively and provide the help they require.
EDUCATION: The New York public school system is falling short in providing quality education for our students. As part of our platform, we advocate for the implementation of school choice and the promotion of parent options to enhance the educational experience.  Additionally, we believe in bringing back trade school instruction to empower future graduates with the skills needed for successful careers. Education should be a pathway to personal and professional fulfillment.
DEFENSE / VETERANS: While it is imperative to provide steadfast support to our troops during their service, it is equally crucial to maintain unwavering assistance upon their return and during times of adversity. These brave individuals have made immense sacrifices to protect us, and it is our duty to offer them our utmost support. Our veterans deserve exceptional benefits and top-notch medical attention, especially when they return wounded after serving our country.
IMMIGRATION: I stand firmly against illegal immigration and amnesty for undocumented individuals. My approach to addressing the challenges posed by illegal immigration consists of three key components:  Securing the Border: Implementing robust measures to secure our borders is essential for maintaining the integrity of our immigration system.  Vigorous Law Enforcement: Enforcing our immigration laws vigorously is crucial to ensuring a fair and just process for all.  Reforming the System: We need to reform the immigration system to benefit those who seek legal entry into our country. This involves promoting hard work, language acquisition, and successful integration as proud Americans.
EDUCATION: Another critical aspect of our platform focuses on preventing the hypersexualization of children in the classroom. Our commitment is to prioritize teaching critical thinking skills, guiding students to learn how to think independently rather than prescribing specific ideologies.
TAXES / BUDGET: I am committed to advocating for the continuation of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. I firmly oppose reinstating the marriage penalty, reducing the child tax credit, or maintaining the estate tax.

INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: The City’s raised crosswalk installations are a step in the right direction, and I’ll fight for funding to keep up installation here while investing in our sidewalk network and adding protected crossings wherever feasible.
EDUCATION: It’s time we fixed these issues and provided universal access to everyone both for kids and parents who have made the difficult decision to step back from their careers to care for their children. We owe it to these kids and their parents to provide after-school for every single child.
HOUSING: Housing policy is climate policy. We need to build more, greener housing without sacrificing the essence of Cambridge. Our city must remain walkable and transit-based.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: Right now, getting from place to place is just too hard. Transportation is a huge cost-of-living driver, a threat to our economic competitiveness, and our most significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. We need to invest in our transit system and make our roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: I’m pushing hard on making Cambridge a net-zero city.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: As our national leadership guts climate protections, it’s on us to keep fighting for the climate future we deserve. Some of our most significant levers for climate action are housing and transportation policy – despite the attention on national policy, state and local governments control most of what goes on there.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: Frequent and affordable bus service is a backbone of our transit system. As the T continues with its generational Bus Network Redesign, I’ve worked to ensure that Cambridge gets routes that meet current transportation needs. Boston has made significant investments in city-wide Transit Signal Priority, and Cambridge should be next..
HOUSING: Cambridge must build more transit-oriented housing and pursue development without displacement through tenant protections. We also need statewide solutions to tackle our statewide housing crisis.

HOUSING: I will look at our inclusionary housing ordinance to consider a higher percentage of affordable units, push to integrate housing in any large scale commercial development, and to allow for increased housing density near transit while keeping what we love about Davis and Teele Squares.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: We need to move forward with municipal curbside composting to get our food waste out of garbage cans where rats can get it, and enforce fines for businesses and landowners who don’t eliminate known rat habitat and food sources.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: We also need reliable and accessible public transportation that meets residents’ needs. I’ll fight for a fare-free MBTA with improved routes and hours of service. I will also fight for micro-transit with improved north-south connectivity.
GOVERNMENT REFORM: I will advocate for seniors to have a voice in city government and policies that help seniors stay in their homes, such as home modification grants for the installation of accessibility features.

By that I mean NYC needs to increase its maritime industry, we need to begin importing things into the city via boat instead of via large and dangerous 18 wheeler trucks.

I am talking about administrators and consultants, some of whom are making six figure salaries and providing either duplicative support or providing no service to the DOE at all. Freeing up the schools from oppressive administrators who have to constantly justify their role in the education system will free up funds which can be allocate to all schools to make needed improvements and free up teachers to do what they are trained to do and that is educate the best they can.
IMMIGRATION: I will make sure that whether someone is a citizen or not, they are able to quickly be permitted to find employment and are protected from exploitative working conditions.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: NYPD settlements MUST be paid from NYPD pension, not by taxpayers.
ECONOMY: Reduce all the fines on small businesses. I already explained how difficult it is to follow all the rules and even to know about all the rules, burdening our small business owners with fines and penalties for mistakes instead of working with them to correct them is not the way to keep our economy strong.
ECONOMY: FEE FREE NYC: A small business might pay anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 before their first day of business just to the NYC government for things like permits and licenses.
ECONOMY: Work with the Digital Transformation Team to create an easy to understand and access guidebook so entrepreneurs are aware of exactly what they need to get their business started.
IMMIGRATION: I will make sure that they are able to access housing.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: We will not criminalize the homeless. We will push to create safer and trusted places to get those working New Yorkers back on their feet and those who suffer from addiction and mental health the place and help they need to recover and rehabilitate their lives.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: I plan to bring to City Council: Ending Qualified Immunity Ending No-Knock Raids Ending Civil Asset Forfeiture Ending School to Prison Pipeline.
IMMIGRATION: I will not allow the state or the federal government to violate our citys sanctuary laws. We will be an Ellis Island style city again.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Full Decriminalization of all drugs. Expunge all criminal records of drug charges. Immediate release of all prisoners sentenced for drug charges.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: I believe that abolish zoning will push developers to build a lot more mixed used buildings were strictly regulated under the 1961 code. This will help bring communities together, have livelier streets, eyes on the streets for safety, and more spaces for small businesses to operate.
INFRASTRUCTURE / TRANSPORTATION: The solution to this problem though is not to make the city more car-friendly, the solution is to provide a better and more viable option. This means improving our public transit and making the city more bike-friendly.",1,1
Z2lkOi8vYmFsbG90LWZhY3RvcnkvQ2FuZGlkYWN5LzEwODMzMjU=,Matthew I. Morgan,26.179,"ECONOMY: Helping NYC small venues (bars, music venues, comedy clubs, event spaces) keep their doors open by fighting for them to have lower insurance costs and lower rents.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Enhanced protection under NYC Whistleblower Laws for any officer that comes forward against one or more officers who engaged in racial profiling, police brutality, etc.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: I believe that if NYC is serious about improving quality of life, street safety, and air quality then we must return to the water. By that I mean NYC needs to increase its maritime industry, we need to begin importing things into the city via boat instead of via large and dangerous 18 wheeler trucks.
ENVIRONMENT / ENERGY: NYC should push developers to build even more green roofs on new buildings as it has shown that green roofs reduce the city's heat island effect, decrease energy costs, improve air and water quality, sequester carbon, and provide habitat for urban wildlife.
ECONOMY: I work every day with some of the hardest working small business owners in the city and I know the effort it takes to run a small business, and I see the effort it takes to run a small business while also navigating the labyrinth of rules and regulations that NYC government forces entrepreneurs to go through before they can even open their doors.
ECONOMY: Streamline the permit and licensing process so entrepreneurs can get their business started faster. Also I will seek to make sure all associated fees are eliminated, the city can make its money once a small business has been created and is generating revenue, not before.
ECONOMY: Incentivizing developers to build more commercial spaces that can be sold and bought my small businesses so they can have more control of their destiny.
IMMIGRATION: If I am elected I will make sure that whoever is the Mayor does not cooperate and does not allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement into our neighborhoods.
ECONOMY: Allow and incentivize developers to build smaller commercial spaces. This will help give new small businesses a place to get started with a lower rent than being forced into a large space. This will also prevent neighborhoods from being dominated by large chains.
ECONOMY: I will work to create networks and non-government organizations of small business owners so they can pull together their resources and knowledge to cut costs and grow their business.

HOUSING: I grew up in public housing, later struggled with housing instability as a tenant, and only recently navigated the long, uncertain road to homeownership. Everyone deserves a safe, stable home, and I’ll fight for policies that make housing affordable and protect tenants’ rights across our city.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: Experience has taught me that real safety begins with opportunity. I’ll invest in public health, trauma informed schools, and community led programs to tackle chronic poverty, adverse childhood experiences, and untreated addiction, the factors that drive crime.
WAGES / JOB BENEFITS: Our economy should work for working people. I’ll fight to strengthen labor protections and expand opportunities for good-paying, union jobs right here in New Bedford..

GOVERNMENT REFORM: I pledge to sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to stop the so-called ""City of Yes"" plan, which may sound positive but threatens to override local zoning laws. This top-down approach would silence neighborhood voices and force oversized developments into already crowded communities, straining schools, infrastructure, and public safety. Nearly 70% of residents oppose upzoning without real community input. We must protect local decision-making and preserve the character and stability of our neighborhoods-not hand control to unelected bureaucrats.
IMMIGRATION: I pledge to sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to repeal New York City's sanctuary city status and end the laws that are overwhelming our schools, hospitals, housing, and contributing to rising crime involving illegal migrants. These failed policies have already cost taxpayers over $6#billion-money that should be used to help our own struggling citizens instead. We must protect public safety and public services for New Yorkers first, ensuring every family has fair access to education, healthcare, and housing.
HEALTHCARE: No citizen of our city & state should be forced to undergo any medical procedure as a job requirement or for any other benefit of living in our city & state. How each person decides to approach their health care, and the care of their minor children should not be dictated by employers, government, or places of public accommodation. When I am elected I will introduce legislation that will make it a criminal offense for anyone to require specific health care choices for other people as a condition of employment or to provide services, or for any public accommodation.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PUBLIC SAFETY: I pledge to sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to restore law and order in New York City. The dangerous pro-criminal laws forced on us by Albany must be repealed-even if that means legal action against the state. Our police departments must be fully funded so they can protect every neighborhood. District Attorneys who refuse to prosecute violent criminals must be held accountable, regardless of their party.
